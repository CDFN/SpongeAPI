/**
 * A value parameter modifier is an alternative to attempting to create an
 * element that extends/wraps around a {@link ValueParameter}, particularly
 * those that are provided by Sponge on behalf of Minecraft or other
 * underlying implementation.
 *
 * <p>The primary intention of a modifier is to enable custom filtering logic
 * so that plugins can refine the user experience when using their commands,
 * while retaining most of the properties of the underlying parameter. In
 * general, plugins <strong>should not</strong> use modifiers on their own
 * {@link ValueParameter value parameters} or associated classes.</p>
 *
 * <p>These modifier methods are provided the same information as the original
 * parameter, along with the result of the original parameter - that is, these
 * modifiers run <strong>after</strong> the associated parameter has run.</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>Modifiers are not designed to transform the returned type</strong>
 * - this is to maintain the integrity of the key typing and to discourage
 * additional logic in parameter parsing that should actually exist in the
 * {@link CommandExecutor} of the command instead.</p>
 *
 * <p>Users of modifiers should consider the following when modifying the
 * result:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Any supplied parameters may have been modified by the associated
 *     parameter that this is modifying, and are not snapshots from before.</li>
 *     <li>The {@link ArgumentReader} is <strong>immutable</strong>. This is to
 *     prevent accidental continued parsing. If you want to use a modifier to
 *     further parse the input string based on the result of chained parameter,
 *     create a custom {@link ValueParameter} that follows on from the node in
 *     question instead - the result of this parse will be available in the
 *     {@link CommandContext.Builder} in later nodes.</li>
 *     <li>Modifiers may choose to <strong>not</strong> return a value and
 *     instead add to the {@link CommandContext.Builder} directly. While this is
 *     permissible, do not be tempted to use modifiers as a way to perform logic
 *     this is not directly related to parsing a string to avoid unnecessary
 *     processing that may not be used if a later node fails to parse and this
 *     node's result is discarded.</li>
 *     <li>Modifiers cannot prevent the chained parameter from thrown an
 *     exception, in the case that they do so this modifier will not be called.
 *     Instead, add a second {@link ValueParser} to the parameter, and account
 *     for this in your modifier.</li>
 *     <li>The use of a modifier will require that any completion requests are
 *     sent to the server, regardless of whether completions are actually
 *     modified. If completions are not being modified, consider whether it
 *     would be better to process the parsed result in the body of your executor
 *     instead.</li>
 * </ul>
